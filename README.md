# Quadcopter-Simulation
This repository consists of Quadcopter Simulation using Simulink and MATLAB R2021a. This is part of the Virtual Laboratory Project from System and Cybernetics Laboratory, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology. This simulation consists of three main parts:
1. Attitude Control
2. Velocity Control
3. Position Control
All of these control system use PID as the controller

The main reference that I used for making this simulation is:

Ferry, N. Quadcopter Plant Model and Control System Development with MATLAB/Simulink Implementation. Diss. Rochester Institute of Technology, 2017.

How to use : 
1. Run the Quadcopter_Parameters.m to initiate the parameters.
2. Open and run the simulink file.

Thank you
